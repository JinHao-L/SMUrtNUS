## What's the problem?

Currently in Singapore, there is a growing number of elderly living alone. This poses a serious problem as a significant number of deaths among the elderly recently are associated with domestic-related accidents such as falls, choking and cardiac arrests. SCDF works closely with Community First Responders (CFRs) to provide timely relief and response to emergency situations. With an increasingly aging population and a growing segment of vulnerable populations in mind (e.g. increasing trend of elderly with no next of kin), we require better sense-making for emergency services to be alerted at the onset of incidents which require emergency response (e.g. cardiac arrests, falls, unattended cooking fires etc.) and mobilise CFRs for effective early intervention especially to the vulnerable populations.

## How can technology help?

Fortunately, in the current digital age we are living in, there is a rising trend of elderly using smartphones. Hence, we could leverage on such trends to deliver help to the elderly digitally. Modern technologies such as those used in FitBit which helps track vital signs during exercises can be incorporated into our solution to help curb the problem we are facing.

## The idea


It is pivotal that emergency response measures can be improved and enhanced despite the growing rate of ageing population. Especially in times of COVID-19 situations where there is restriction of caregivers moving freely to person-at-risk houses frequently, this initiative which leverages IBM Cloud and Watson Services, will enable caregivers and emergency services to deliver help to the persons-at-risk at the most critical time as well as maintaining social responsibility.

## The Architecture

*Mechanism*

1.  Every 5 minutes, the SMartNUS ring will send environmental data such as heart rate and temperature to the SMartNUS mobile application. This will be our routine check.
    
2.  The data will then be sent to the ibm server to be passed to our prediction model built using IBM Auto A.I.
    
3.  The model will then analyse this data and make a prediction on whether there is an accident and if so, what type of accident will it be.
    
4.  If the model predicts an accident, the SMartNUS app will alert the caregiver and prompt him or her to contact the wearer.
    
5.  If the wearer picks up, they may decide to call 995 depending on the severity of the accident if it occurs. Or else, the caregiver should call 995 immediately.
    
6.  After the accident is taken care of, all data including the actual emergency type will be logged and recorded for refining the prediction model in the future.
    

 *Emergency Button* 

1.  The wearer can also directly trigger a manual emergency alert by pressing and holding the emergency button on the ring for 3 seconds.
    
2.  This manual alert will cause the SMartNUS app to simultaneously contact emergency services and the caregiver of a potential accident.
    
3.  The caregiver or the wearer may disable this alert through the SMartNUS app if it was unintentionally triggered.
    
4.  The data corresponding to the time of this incident, as well as the outcome will be also recorded into IBM’s cloud database to refine the prediction model. The automated A.I. will relearn every 2 weeks.

## Demo

  

Setting up of profile (**DEMO**): [https://smurtnus.mybluemix.net/ui](https://smurtnus.mybluemix.net/)

  

The link above showcases an example of the setup of the elderly’s profile when their information is added into the system. Depending on the parameters of the data of each elderly which are updated on the system, a predicted accident (if any) will then be generated through the IBM Auto A.I. software.

  

**Disclaimer: This is an example of the prototype to illustrate our idea using the parameters of our app**

  
  
  
## Getting started  

#### Create the AutoAI Machine Learning model: 
1. Download the sample csv in the repository

2. Follow the [link](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/autoai_example_binary_classifier.html) to build and deploy the model


#### Using the flow:  
1. Create a Node Red account

2. Using the "Manage Palette" install the following dependencies: 
    - node-red-contrib-watson-machine-learning
    - node-red-dashboard
  
3. Import the flow under [src/SMUrtNUS.json](https://github.com/JinHao-L/SMUrtNUS/blob/master/src/SMUrtNUS_flow.json) to the Node Red environment

4. Setup the WML config of the WML node to connect with the AutoAI prediction model

  
  

## Evaluation

  

*Strengths*

  

1.  The SMUrtNUS ring is worn on the person-at-risk at all times which gives constant and timely updates to the caregiver
    
2.  Emergency red button to contact caregiver and garner attention if required, provides comprehensive coverage of accidents outside of the ones AI can predict: fall, cardiac arrest and choking
    
3.  The SMUrtNUS ring and SMUrtNUS mobile application’s functions are passive and do not require much involvement from the person-at-risk to function properly, hence even non tech-savvy persons-at-risk can utilise the ring and mobile application.
    

  

*Weaknesses*

  

1.  If the vulnerable person accidentally triggers the button while he is sleeping, and does not receive the phone call from the caregiver, a false alarm will be triggered
    
2.  Some vulnerable persons may not have a wifi connection for the data transmission to the server for the predictive service.
